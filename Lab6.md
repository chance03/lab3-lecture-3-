### Version Control and Collaboration
---

It's essential to use a version control system for software development.
The basic solution is to make copies.

### Changes VS Snapshots
---

Changes stores data as changes to the base version.

Snapshots stores data as snapshots.

### Three States in Git
There's three states in Git, Modified, Staged, and Comitted.


### Git config : First - time setup
Git configurations are stored in three levels : 

1. System level : --system option. It affects all uses and repositories on the system. It is administrative.

2. Global (user) level : --global option. It affects all repositories of a current user.

3. Local level : --local option. It is specific to the current repository.

Each level overrides values in the previous level : system -> global -> local.
